Queues

# Queues

## What are queues?
Queues are a way to store items. They can be implemented using lists, or through the `collections.dequeue` class. Using the class is recommended as it can handle more than using lists.

Queues are basically the opposite of a stack. Stacks operate under a last in, first out (LIFO) principle, while queues are first in, first out (FIFO).

A good example is a pipe that transports basketballs. The new basketballs are put in at the end (enqueueing) and are only taken out at the front (dequeueing). You can't open the pipe and take out a basketball.

## Queue use cases	
Queues are great for any FIFO operation, such as people on a waitlist, or keeping track of orders.

## Problem
Doctor Who needs help keeping track of who's next in line. He keeps losing his printout and would like to have it digitally. 

Create a queue that will store the names of any patient names supplied.

Write code for this later
