Trees

# Trees

## What are trees?

Trees are a useful tool. They are similar to linked lists in that they point to the next item/node, but differ in that they can point to multiple items.

For example, binary trees can connect to no more than 2 nodes.

Keep the following in mind about trees:

* The highest node is called the **root node**. 
* Nodes that have connections are called **parent nodes**. 
* Nodes that have parent nodes are called **child nodes**.
* Nodes that have no child nodes are called **leaf nodes**.
* And to steal from the reading, "The nodes to the left and right of any parent node form a **subtree**".
* There can only be **one** root node.

## Tree use cases
Trees can be used for efficient searching and organizing of data. Especially when combined with recursion.
