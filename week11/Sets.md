Sets

# Sets

## What are sets?
Sets are a data structure for storing multiple items in a single variable.

They are declared using curly braces.

Sets cannot have duplicates, and if any are inputted, it will automatically remove duplicates.

Remember, sets are **unordered**,  **unindexed**, and **unchangeable**.
<br />
## Set use cases
If you have multiple items you need to store without having to care about order, use a set. 

<br />

## Examples

```
# Note the two "apple" items. When you print, how many "apples" are there?

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

print(thisset)
```
<br />

## Problem
Write a set called `snacks` that includes at least 3 of your favorite snack foods.
