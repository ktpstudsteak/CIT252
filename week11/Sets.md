Sets

# Sets

## What are sets?
Sets are a data structure for storing multiple items in a single variable.

They are declared using curly braces.

Sets cannot have duplicates, and if any are inputted, it will automatically remove duplicates.

Remember, sets are **unordered**,  **unindexed**, and **unchangeable**.
<br />
## Set use cases
If you have multiple items you need to store without having to care about order, use a set. 

<br />
